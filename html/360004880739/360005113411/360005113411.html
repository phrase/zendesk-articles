<p>Linguists are translators, reviewers or proofreaders and have a <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013918760" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specified role</a> in Memsource.</p>
<p>Linguists predominantly work within the <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012775880" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memsource Editor</a>. It is easy to access a job and start translating, but it is highly recommended that some time is spent looking into the <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003807219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">features</a> of the editor before getting started.</p>
<p>The first step for linguists is account access. New linguist users receive an email with instructions on how to <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014250879" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up a password</a>.</p>
<p>Linguists are presented with the <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013918760-Linguist-Overview#linguist-portal-0-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linguist Portal</a> once logged in. This is where assigned <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013675740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jobs</a> are managed.</p>
<p>Clicking on a job opens it in the <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012775920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memsource Editor for Web</a>. This is the preferred tool as all <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013766279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">translation memories</a> and <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013766299" target="_blank" rel="noopener">term bases</a> associated with the selected job are automatically connected.</p>
<p>If preferred, and the project manager gives permission, jobs can be downloaded for editing in the <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012775900" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memsource Editor for Desktop</a>. Login credentials are required to access <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003999700-Translation-Resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">translation resources</a> and proxy settings, if required, are provided by a network administrator.</p>
<p>When a job is complete, the linguist <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013675740-Jobs-Overview#change-job-status-0-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changes the status</a> to <span class="guimenu">Completed</span> and the jobs are no longer accessible for editing.</p>
