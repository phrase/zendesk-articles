<p>Data uploaded by Memsource clients (including metadata) can potentially be used for training machine learning models. This data is not shared with other users, nor is it possible to extract it from the models as they do not produce any content.</p>
<p>All content is treated as if containing personal information, so all data for ML is handled in accordance with the rules imposed by <a class="link" href="https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003638611" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDPR</a>. Client data (or anyone's data) is not resold for profit. This data can't be reconstructed or reverse engineered. None of the AI features generate any textual content, only the labeling of content with metadata (e.g. MT quality category, non-translatable, etc).</p>
<p>When training models, all relevant data is aggregated from Memsource and models are constructed from it. After no more than 90 days (as required by GDPR), all data is deleted and only the models remain. These models do not contain customer data, as they do not store sentences. The neural network model is a complex mathematical formula that calculates a quality score based on the source sentence and its translation. Training the model involves adjusting the parameters of the formula until it provides desired results.</p>

<p>Training data is processed by the machine learning algorithm to create (train) a model. This model is used in the feature to predict non-translatables, MT quality (MTQE) or to recommend an optimal MT engine.</p>
<p>While the training data may contain personal data, the resulting model does not. Any personal data is anonymized during the training process.</p>

<p>When new content is processed with MT a numerical representation is created, fed to the formula and a score is calculated. If identical to training sentences, it indicates the formula is already optimized to generate the correct translation.</p>
<p>The formula is designed to learn and identify patterns in data; to generalize. It will, for example, learn that when it sees <span class="emphasis"><em>cat</em></span> in the English source, the MT should contain <span class="emphasis"><em>gatto</em></span> in Italian to be considered good. MT that doesn't contain it is bad. These learned patterns are then applied to any newly submitted sentences and MT output.</p>

<p>When submitting source content to machine translation providers, Memsource encrypts the data in transit. When processed by the MT engine, the data is subject to the MT providers terms of service and privacy policies.</p>

<p>Better results has been observed with <span class="emphasis"><em>chrf3</em></span>, and it is more reliable when scoring individual sentences. It also handles various language types, such as morphologically rich languages or CJK languages.</p>

<p>If a score is not provided, the segment is likely not worth post-editing but it may also mean that the model may not be confident enough to answer. Separating these two situations is in development.</p>

<p>Memsource collects training data from existing segments. An algorithm is applied that identifies different domains making up the training data. Although obtained automatically, the detected domains correspond well to standardized domains (e.g. <span class="emphasis"><em>medical</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>travel/hospitality</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>software</em></span>, etc).</p>
<p>For each language pair and domain, the performance of machine translation engines is monitored. When a new document is uploaded for translation, the model detects which of these domains are present. The most relevant domain is selected (e.g. If a document is 60% legal and 40% medical, it is categorized as <span class="emphasis"><em>legal</em></span>) and the current best engine for the legal domain and corresponding language pair is recommended.</p>
